# C++ Linked List Implementation

This repository contains C++ linked list implementation, simple test harness, and a suite of unit tests.

The only dependencies herein are on the C++ standard library (C++17 standard), excluding all functionality from the standard containers.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you need the following installed:

- A `g++` compiler capable of compiling to the C++17 standard (e.g. `-std=c++17`)
- `make`

Once you have these tools installed, run `make test-ll` to execute the tests.
