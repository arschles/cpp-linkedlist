# C++ Linked List Implementation

This repository contains C++ code to implement a linked list functionality to operate on the data within the linked list data structure.

This codebase contains:

- The linked list implementation
- A simple test harness
- A suite of unit tests

Furthermore, this codebase is not dependent on any external libraries, and also does not rely on any aggregate container data structures from the standard library.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you need the following installed:

- A `g++` compiler capable of compiling to the C++17 standard (e.g. `-std=c++17`)
- `make`

Once you have these tools installed, run `make test-ll` to execute the tests.
